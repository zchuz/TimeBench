It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality.

The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne.

The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success.

When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space.

In 1836, he was appointed as joint secretary to the General Post Office, where he strongly opposed the introduction of the Penny Post, a plan championed by Rowland Hill to charge a fixed price for postage (as is now the normal practice in most of the world).

In 1670, he was promoted to the rank of \"jinshi\" and moved to Beijing, leaving his brother Li Guangpo behind to look after his family. Li's career prospects improved when the Emperor pacified Fujian and acted on Li's suggestion to defeat Wu Sangui. He also helped defeat Geng Jingzhong, persuading his friend Chen Minglei to work as a spy in Geng's camp. Later in life, he was responsible for planning Shi Lang's conquest of Taiwan. During the course of his life, Li held various court positions, including Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, Governor of Zhili and Grand Secretary, and positions on the Board of War, Board of Civil Service and the Board of Public Works.Li's philosophy was rooted in the Cheng-Zhu school. However, despite being a follower of Zhu Xi he did not entirely disregard the teachings of Zhu's rivals Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He also highlighted similarities between the teachings of Confucius and those of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Li felt that human nature (which he believed to be inherently good) was the ultimate subject of his study, and that nature was the guiding principle on which to base human morality. He had an interest in the sciences.Li wrote or edited a number of philosophical texts, including the \"Complete Works of Master Zhu\" (\"Zhuzi daquan\"), the \"Essential Ideas of Nature and Principle\" (\"Xingli jingli\") and the \"Interpretation of the Meaning of the Four Books\" (\"Si shu Jieyi\").

Cronin also added an FAI Cup winners medal as Bohs achieved the \"Double\" by beating Derry City on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw. The 2009 season was also a successful one for Cronin when, firstly, the Gypsies won the League of Ireland Cup by beating Waterford United 3\u20131 at the RSC.

His research focuses on the mechanisms of innate immunity and endosymbiosis in Drosophila. Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-\u03baB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

She studied social sciences at Harvard before deciding to focus on science. She went to McGill University in Montreal where she studied biology, genetics and chemistry. She faced prejudice from colleagues because she was a single mother.She began teaching at University of Quebec at Montreal in 1976 and two years later she was conducting research amongst phosphate workers. She knew of the potential and radioactivity and discovered that amongst six workers, four of them had children with birth defects like a club foot. She did manage to get dust extraction equipment installed but only on the proviso that the researchers left the factory. Messing reflects that this event focused her later work on occupational health.In 1990 she spent a year studying a toilet cleaner named Nina who walked 23\u00a0km every day as she cleaned toilets in 1\u20132 minutes. This work led to recommendations that were adopted and to her specializing in ergonomics and winning an award. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993.

His dissertation at Oxford in 1939 established, among other such results, asymptotic formulae for the average value of the square of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. His final Examining Board at Oxford University consisted of G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood and E.C. Titchmarsh.His first academic appointment was at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1939-1940, followed by a commission (1940) in the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmer\u00f3n joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusi\u00f3n\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almer\u00eda recovering from a serious illness. Salmer\u00f3n was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmer\u00f3n was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmer\u00f3n was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmer\u00f3n took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmer\u00f3n went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party. He died at Pau on 21 September 1908 at the age of 70.He was the last living president of the First Spanish Republic.", "fact_context": "Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Catalan Solidarity from Jan, 1906 to Jan, 1908. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Republican Union from Jan, 1903 to Jan, 1906. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Progressive Party from Jan, 1875 to Jan, 1903. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Democratic Federal Republican Party from Jan, 1868 to Jan, 1875."}

He was spotted by Bury, of the English Football League First Division, and moved to Lancashire in August 1896, aged 18.In his short time with the \"Shakers\" he made only three first-team appearances, in the outside-left berth, but was unable to displace Jack Plant, who later went on to represent England. Steven fell out with Bury, who refused to release his Football League registration, and returned to Scotland. After briefly re-joining Dundee, he came back to England in the 1897 close season, signing for the Southern League champions, Southampton, who were not members of the Football League and were thus not affected by Bury's refusal to release his registration papers.At the \"Saints\", his \"\"fearless, dashing forward play\"\" made him popular with the fans. He made his debut in a 2\u20131 victory over Reading on 19 February 1898 replacing Robert Buchanan at inside-right, with Buchanan moving to centre-forward in place of the injured Jack Farrell.

Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading scholars of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz. After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio.Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Bau\u00dfnern, Alexander Ilyinsky, Agnes Tschetschulin, and Leopold Godowsky. Besides teaching and composing, Bargiel served with Brahms as co-editor of the complete editions of Schumann's and Chopin's works. While Bargiel did not write a lot of music, most of what he composed was well thought out and shows solid musical craftsmanship.

It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality.

The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne.

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success.

When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space.

In 1836, he was appointed as joint secretary to the General Post Office, where he strongly opposed the introduction of the Penny Post, a plan championed by Rowland Hill to charge a fixed price for postage (as is now the normal practice in most of the world). One of Maberly's principal secretaries during his time at the Post Office was the novelist Anthony Trollope, who later parodied Maberly as Sir Boreas Bodkin in the novel \"Marion Fay\".

In 1670, he was promoted to the rank of \"jinshi\" and moved to Beijing, leaving his brother Li Guangpo behind to look after his family. Li's career prospects improved when the Emperor pacified Fujian and acted on Li's suggestion to defeat Wu Sangui. He also helped defeat Geng Jingzhong, persuading his friend Chen Minglei to work as a spy in Geng's camp. Later in life, he was responsible for planning Shi Lang's conquest of Taiwan. During the course of his life, Li held various court positions, including Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, Governor of Zhili and Grand Secretary, and positions on the Board of War, Board of Civil Service and the Board of Public Works.Li's philosophy was rooted in the Cheng-Zhu school. However, despite being a follower of Zhu Xi he did not entirely disregard the teachings of Zhu's rivals Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He also highlighted similarities between the teachings of Confucius and those of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Li felt that human nature (which he believed to be inherently good) was the ultimate subject of his study, and that nature was the guiding principle on which to base human morality. He had an interest in the sciences.Li wrote or edited a number of philosophical texts, including the \"Complete Works of Master Zhu\" (\"Zhuzi daquan\"), the \"Essential Ideas of Nature and Principle\" (\"Xingli jingli\") and the \"Interpretation of the Meaning of the Four Books\" (\"Si shu Jieyi\").

Cronin also added an FAI Cup winners medal as Bohs achieved the \"Double\" by beating Derry City on penalties after a 2\u20132 draw. The 2009 season was also a successful one for Cronin when, firstly, the Gypsies won the League of Ireland Cup by beating Waterford United 3\u20131 at the RSC.

His research focuses on the mechanisms of innate immunity and endosymbiosis in Drosophila. Lemaitre has also authored several books on the topic of narcissism in science.Lemaitre obtained a PhD in genetics from the Universit\u00e9 Pierre-et-Marie-Curie in 1992, defending a thesis on the regulation of P element transposition in Drosophila. He then pursued work as research associate in the laboratory of Jules Hoffmann, where he identified Toll-like receptors as essential mediators of innate immunity in Drosophila. This work was considered as a landmark paper by the Nobel prize committee and was featured in the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine awarded to Hoffmann. In 1998, he was appointed group leader at the Molecular Genetics Center of the French National Center for Scientific Research in Gif-sur-Yvette. He moved to EPFL in 2007 as a full professor within the Global Health Institute.Lemaitre has since 2016 published several books and essays related to the topic of narcissism in science and society. He is co-author of various MOOCs and an exercise book in French on the topic of immunology.The Lemaitre laboratory studies various aspects of innate immunity using Drosophila as a genetic model. The laboratory uses genetic screens as tools to identify novel factors involved in the immune response following microbial infection. His team has contributed to the better understanding the role of the Toll and NF-\u03baB pathways in the activation of bacterial defense, as well as how the host's immune system discriminates between different bacterial pathogens. Lemaitre also studies host-microbiota interactions, and more specifically how the microbiota influences gut homeostasis and morphology.Another aspect of interest to Lemaitre is to decipher the roles and mechanisms of the interactions occurring between Drosophila and its endosymbionts of the spiroplasma genus.Lemaitre received two \"Advanced Grants\" from the European Research Council for projects on gut immunity and homeostasis (2008) and Drosophila-Spiroplasma interactions (2013).Lemaitre was elected as an EMBO member in 2007.He received several research prizes, such as the Noury, Thorlet, Lazare Prize from the French Academy of Sciences (2001), the First Prize of the Schlumberger Foundation (2002), the William B.

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

She studied social sciences at Harvard before deciding to focus on science. She went to McGill University in Montreal where she studied biology, genetics and chemistry. She faced prejudice from colleagues because she was a single mother.She began teaching at University of Quebec at Montreal in 1976 and two years later she was conducting research amongst phosphate workers. She knew of the potential and radioactivity and discovered that amongst six workers, four of them had children with birth defects like a club foot. She did manage to get dust extraction equipment installed but only on the proviso that the researchers left the factory. Messing reflects that this event focused her later work on occupational health.In 1990 she spent a year studying a toilet cleaner named Nina who walked 23\u00a0km every day as she cleaned toilets in 1\u20132 minutes. This work led to recommendations that were adopted and to her specializing in ergonomics and winning an award. She was given the Jacques Rousseau Award in 1993.

His dissertation at Oxford in 1939 established, among other such results, asymptotic formulae for the average value of the square of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. His final Examining Board at Oxford University consisted of G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood and E.C. Titchmarsh.His first academic appointment was at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1939-1940, followed by a commission (1940) in the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmer\u00f3n joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusi\u00f3n\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almer\u00eda recovering from a serious illness. Salmer\u00f3n was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration. When Amadeo of Savoy resigned the Spanish crown on 11 February 1873 Salmer\u00f3n was naturally marked out to be a leader of the party which endeavoured to establish a republic in Spain. After serving as minister of justice in the Figueras cabinet, he was chosen president of the \"Cortes\", and then, on 18 July 1873, president of the Executive Power of the Republic, in succession to Francisco Pi y Margall. He became president at a time when the Federalist Party had thrown all the south of Spain into anarchy.Salmer\u00f3n was compelled to use the troops to restore order. When, however, he found that the generals insisted on executing rebels taken in arms, he resigned (September 6) on the ground that he was opposed to capital punishment. He was again elected president of the Cortes on September 9. His successor, Castelar, was compelled to restore order by drastic means. Salmer\u00f3n took part in the attack made on him in the \"Cortes\" on 3 January 1874, which provoked the generals into closing the chamber and establishing a provisional military government. Salmer\u00f3n went into exile and remained abroad till 1881, when he was recalled by Sagasta.In 1886, he was elected to the \"Cortes\" as Progressive deputy for Madrid, and unsuccessfully endeavoured to combine the jarring republican factions into a party of practical moderate views. On 18 April 1907 he was shot at, but not wounded, in the streets of Barcelona by a member of the more extreme Republican Party. He died at Pau on 21 September 1908 at the age of 70.He was the last living president of the First Spanish Republic.", "fact_context": "Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Catalan Solidarity from Jan, 1906 to Jan, 1908. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Republican Union from Jan, 1903 to Jan, 1906. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Progressive Party from Jan, 1875 to Jan, 1903. \n Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n y Alonso is a member of the Democratic Federal Republican Party from Jan, 1868 to Jan, 1875."}

He was spotted by Bury, of the English Football League First Division, and moved to Lancashire in August 1896, aged 18.In his short time with the \"Shakers\" he made only three first-team appearances, in the outside-left berth, but was unable to displace Jack Plant, who later went on to represent England. Steven fell out with Bury, who refused to release his Football League registration, and returned to Scotland. After briefly re-joining Dundee, he came back to England in the 1897 close season, signing for the Southern League champions, Southampton, who were not members of the Football League and were thus not affected by Bury's refusal to release his registration papers.At the \"Saints\", his \"\"fearless, dashing forward play\"\" made him popular with the fans. He made his debut in a 2\u20131 victory over Reading on 19 February 1898 replacing Robert Buchanan at inside-right, with Buchanan moving to centre-forward in place of the injured Jack Farrell.

Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading scholars of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz. After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio.Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Bau\u00dfnern, Alexander Ilyinsky, Agnes Tschetschulin, and Leopold Godowsky. Besides teaching and composing, Bargiel served with Brahms as co-editor of the complete editions of Schumann's and Chopin's works. While Bargiel did not write a lot of music, most of what he composed was well thought out and shows solid musical craftsmanship.
