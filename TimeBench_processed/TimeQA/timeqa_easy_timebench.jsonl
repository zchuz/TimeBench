Leopold took a job with the United States Geological Survey , where she worked for 21 years , from 1955 to 1976 . She made important findings about the effects of climate on the evolution and extinction of prehistoric plant species In her work in the Rocky Mountains , she discovered that extinction and evolution of ancient species into newer varians was more prevalent in the middle of the continent because of the wider degree of seasonal changes ; in contrast , coastal areas with more moderate climates supported older species such as the giant redwood . Her work also included studying drilled cores containing pollen from the Miocene Epoch that revealed evidence of a tropical rainforest in the Eniwetok and Bikini Atoll area of the Pacific Ocean By studying plant fossil records from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado , Idaho , and Wyoming , Leopold provided inferences about the paleoenvironment of the Paleogene and Neogene periods .

{"question": "What operated Pennsylvania Railroad class E44 from Apr 1976 to 1981?", "context": "The PRR E44 was an electric , rectifier-equipped locomotive built by General Electric for the Pennsylvania Railroad between 1960 and 1963 . The PRR used them for freight service on the Northeast Corridor . They continued in service under Penn Central and Conrail until Conrail abandoned its electric operations in the early 1980s . They were then acquired by Amtrak and NJ Transit , where they lived short lives ; all were retired by the mid-1980s . One is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania . After the 1968 Penn Central merger , the E44s remained in freight service , over the same territory as before , and ( unlike much of the Penn Central diesel fleet ) , as reliably as before . The paint scheme for most units was Penn Central black with the worms in love logo . At least one unit wore the short-lived red-P logo , with the P in the logo red instead of white . Not all units received a full Penn Central paint scheme , mainly due to the cash-strapped nature of the railroad , which went bankrupt in June 1970 For example , some had white PC numbers and small worms on the ends , while a few never received any new lettering at all , instead having all their PRR markings simply patch-painted over except for their yellow numbers . In 1976 , they were passed to the newly formed Conrail . However , things changed when Conrail eliminated their electrification in 1981 . All 66 E44s were retired at that time , though some units were already stored due to economic downturn ; no unit had ever been retired or seriously wrecked . Most , though not all , of the E44s got to be repainted blue with Conrails white wheel on rail logo .", "answer": ["Conrail"], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Pennsylvania_Railroad_class_E44#P137#2"}

{"question": "Who was the owner of The Fifer from 1911 to 1912?", "context": "The Fifer or Young Flautist is a painting by French painter \u00c9douard Manet , made in 1866 . It is usually kept in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , Paris . On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death . In 1986 , it was moved to its current home in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , the national museum of 19th-century art .

University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison law professor Ann Althouse criticized Feministing in 2006 for its sometimes sexualized content . Erin Matson of the National Organization for Womens Young Feminist Task Force told The Huffington Post the controversy was a rehashing of a very old debate within the feminist community : is public sexuality empowering or harmful to women ?

The submarine answered their waves with fire from its deck gun , but no one was hurt in the attack .

He is best known for the lambda calculus , Church\u2013Turing thesis , proving the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem , Frege\u2013Church ontology , and the Church\u2013Rosser theorem . He also worked on philosophy of language ( see e.g . Church 1970 ) . Alongside Alan Turing , Church has been considered one of the founders of computer science . Church is known for the following significant accomplishments : - His proof that the Entscheidungsproblem , which asks for a decision procedure to determine the truth of arbitrary propositions in a first-order mathematical theory , is undecidable . This is known as Churchs theorem . - His proof that Peano arithmetic is undecidable . - His articulation of what has come to be known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis . - He was the founding editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic , editing its reviews section until 1979 . - His invention of the lambda calculus . The lambda calculus emerged in his 1936 paper showing the unsolvability of the Entscheidungsproblem . This result preceded Alan Turings work on the halting problem , which also demonstrated the existence of a problem unsolvable by mechanical means . Church and Turing then showed that the lambda calculus and the Turing machine used in Turings halting problem were equivalent in capabilities , and subsequently demonstrated a variety of alternative mechanical processes for computation . This resulted in the Church\u2013Turing thesis . The efforts for automatically generating a controller implementation from specifications originates from his ideas . The lambda calculus influenced the design of the LISP programming language and functional programming languages in general . The Church encoding is named in his honor . In his honor the Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation was established in 2015 by the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group for Logic and Computation ( ACM SIGLOG ) , the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science ( EATCS ) , the European Association for Computer Science Logic ( EACSL ) , and the Kurt G\u00f6del Society ( KGS ) .

Her mother , Marie of Orl\u00e9ans , was the sister of King Louis XII of France . In 1523 Charles V appointed the couple jointly viceroys of Valencia . There Germaine , recently returned to Spain , dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds ( Germanies ) . Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats ; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total . This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza , who had favored reconciliation with the rebels In December 1524 , Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion . However , fines imposed on the guilds and guild-aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid . It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia , as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her . Next year after Johanns death in 1525 , Germaine married Ferdinand , Duke of Calabria , a son of King Frederick IV of Naples ( 1496\u20131501 ) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo . The two continued as viceroys of Valencia and were patrons of the arts and music . Germaine also encouraged the slow integration of Valencia with Castilian-dominated Spain as a whole . Germaine died on 15 October 1536 in Liria , probably due to obesity related edema , and was interred in the Monastery of San Miguel de los Reyes .

She conducted research in India in the late 1920s and early 1930s on macrocytic anaemia of pregnancy , a disease which is characterized by enlarged red blood cells and is life-threatening . Pregnant women in the tropics with inadequate diets are particularly susceptible . Wills discovered a nutritional factor in yeast that both prevents and cures this disorder .

Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed , from 1926 , the first feature-length animated film , and Papageno ( 1935 ) . Reiniger is also noted for having devised the first form of a multiplane camera ; she made more than 40 films , all using her invention . Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium . Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation . Reinigers figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move .", "answer": [""], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Lotte_Reiniger#P551#4"}

A member of the Socialist Party ( PS ) , he previously served in the National Assembly from 1981 to 1986 and Senate from 1995 until 2001 . Delano\u00eb became Mayor of Paris on 18 March 2001 , when control of the Council of Paris was won by a left-wing alliance for the first time since 1977 ( election with universal suffrage ) . His predecessors were Jean Tiberi ( 1995\u20132001 ) and Jacques Chirac ( 1977\u20131995 ) , who resigned after 18 years as mayor when he was elected President of the French Republic . Delano\u00eb won the mayorship of Paris at the head of a coalition of Socialists , Greens and Communists , over the conservative candidates Jean Tiberi and Philippe S\u00e9guin , who were unable to resolve their differences and thereby split the conservative vote . This success in a city which had traditionally been a stronghold of the right until the end of the 20th century was made all the more striking by setbacks to the left in the 2001 municipal elections that occurred more generally It has been partially attributed with the weariness of the Parisian public with respect to various scandals of corruption and graft in the preceding administrations . Delano\u00eb was virtually unknown before the election of 2001 , but soon gained fame for organising new and unusual events in Paris , such as the Paris Beach ( Paris-Plages ) on the banks of the Seine every summer in order to give Parisians who could not take a regular vacation a chance to relax , sunbathe and build sandcastles in the center of Paris . The program , especially popular with families with children , has been in place since 2002 , and has since been copied by many other international cities . As mayor , Delano\u00ebs goals were to improve the quality of life , reduce pollution , and cut down on vehicle traffic within the city ( including a plan for a non-polluting tramway to ease Parisian traffic ) and pedestrian malls . He helped introduce a program called V\u00e9lib ( a portmanteau of v\u00e9lo and libre meaning free bicycles ) which gave Parisians access to inexpensive rental bicycles available in stations all around Paris . The program has been enormously successful despite the fact that it still has a few logistical problems to be worked out He has outlined a plan for an autolib , whereby small cars would be shared . He was reelected in 2008 ( 57.7% ) for a new six-year-term ( 2008\u20132014 ) . In 2009 , he criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI , which were of the effect that condom use was unhelpful or even counter-productive in the fight against AIDS .", "answer": ["Mayor of Paris"], "question_type": "in_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Bertrand_Delano\u00eb#P39#2"}

Unlike most coral atolls , the lagoon on Jarvis is wholly dry . Jarvis is one of the Line Islands and for statistical purposes is also grouped as one of the United States Minor Outlying Islands . Jarvis Island is the largest of three U.S . equatorial possessions , which include Baker Island and Howland Island . The American Guano Company , which was incorporated in 1857 , established claims in respect of Baker Island and Jarvis Island which was recognized under the U.S . Guano Islands Act of 1856 . Beginning in 1858 , several support structures were built on Jarvis Island , along with a two-story , eight-room superintendents house featuring an observation cupola and wide verandahs . Tram tracks were laid down for bringing mined guano to the western shore . One of the first loads was taken by Samuel Gardner Wilder . For the following twenty-one years , Jarvis was commercially mined for guano , sent to the United States as fertilizer , but the island was abruptly abandoned in 1879 , leaving behind about a dozen buildings and 8,000 tonnes of mined guano . New Zealand entrepreneurs , including photographer Henry Winkelmann , then made unsuccessful attempts to continue guano extraction on Jarvis , and the two-storey house was sporadically inhabited during the early 1880s . Squire Flockton was left alone on the island as caretaker for several months and committed suicide there in 1883 , apparently from gin-fueled despair . His wooden grave marker was a carved plank which could be seen in the islands tiny four-grave cemetery for decades . John T . Arundel & Co . resumed mining guano from 1886 to 1899 . The United Kingdom annexed the island on June 3 , 1889 . Phosphate and copra entrepreneur John T . Arundel visited the island in 1909 on maiden voyage of the S.S .
