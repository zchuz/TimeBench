At a dinner in July of the same year , he lamented that nothing of great importance had taken place in the House , but he was prepared to stand forward in support of those principles which he had publicly avowed . In 1830 , he voted with the government against transferring the electorate of East Retford into the soon-to-be-created constituency of Birmingham ; against enfranchising Birmingham , Leeds and Manchester ; and against Lord Blandfords parliamentary reform scheme . Despite this , he is not recorded as having spoken during this period , although he petitioned for the abolition of the death penalty for forgery , then voting in that manner in June 1830 .

However , Sanderson returned to the seat a year later , at the 1832 general election , securing the most votes , and held it for another 15 years until 1847 , when he was ranked third in the poll , losing the election . Within this period , he opposed the Maynooth Grant and repealing the Corn Laws , and married the Commons Speakers daughter .", "answer": ["Member of Parliament ( MP )"], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Richard_Sanderson_(MP)#P39#2"}

His scholarship focused on three main projects : The Mediterranean ( 1923\u201349 , then 1949\u201366 ) , Civilization and Capitalism ( 1955\u201379 ) , and the unfinished Identity of France ( 1970\u201385 ) . His reputation stems in part from his writings , but even more from his success in making the Annales School the most important engine of historical research in France and much of the world after 1950 As the dominant leader of the Annales School of historiography in the 1950s and 1960s , he exerted enormous influence on historical writing in France and other countries . He was a student of Henri Hauser ( 1866-1946 ) . Braudel has been considered one of the greatest of the modern historians who have emphasized the role of large-scale socioeconomic factors in the making and writing of history . He can also be considered as one of the precursors of world-systems theory . In his works Braudel shows a revolutionary change of focus in the craft and analysis of history from individuals or events to world systems . Braudels last and most personal book was LIdentit\u00e9 de la France ( The Identity of France ) , which was unfinished at the time of his death in 1985 . Unlike many of Braudels other books , he made no secret of his profound love of his country , remarking at the beginning that he had loved France as if she were a woman . Reflecting his interest with the longue dur\u00e9e , Braudels concern in LIdentit\u00e9 de la France was with the centuries and millennia instead of the years and decades Braudel argued that France was the product not of its politics or economics but rather of its geography and culture , a thesis Braudel explored in a wide-ranging book that saw the bourg and the patois : historie totale integrated into a broad sweep of both the place and the time Unlike Braudels other books , LIdentit\u00e9 de la France was much colored by a romantic nostalgia , as Braudel argued for the existence of la France profonde , a deep France based upon the peasant mentalit\u00e9 that despite all of the turmoil of French history and the Industrial Revolution had survived intact right up to the present .", "answer": [""], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Fernand_Braudel#P108#1"}

J . Hill ( H88 ) for the Great Eastern Railway . They were given the nickname Claud Hamilton after the pioneer engine of the class , named after Lord Claud Hamilton ( 1843\u20131925 ) the chairman of the Great Eastern Railway . The D56 class of 1903-4 evolved the design to include a square-topped Belpaire firebox . The H88 class of 1923 featured a larger superheated boiler , leading them to be known as Super Clauds . Many earlier members of the class were rebuilt during their working life . During the Edwardian era , they were the flagship express locomotive on the Great Eastern Main Line , and although displaced on the heaviest express trains by the larger S69 class from 1911 ( itself a 4-6-0 development of the Claud design ) , members of the class were used on passenger and goods services throughout the Eastern Region until 1960 . No locomotives of the three classes survived to preservation . Originally painted in GER blue with red lining and bronze highlights , following the 1923 grouping the GER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway , and were painted in the companys apple green with LNER on the tender and cab-side numbers . Side rods were polished steel . The appearance was altered when a larger boiler and Belpaire firebox was fitted , meaning a change in the cab window shape as well . 8783 and 8787 were kept in immaculate condition as dedicated Royal locos for hauling the Royal Train from Kings Cross to Wolferton ( the nearest station for Sandringham House ) . 8783 was also fitted with a copper-capped chimney .

Others were painted black with BRITISH RAILWAYS on the tender . Later on they carried both lined and unlined black with the early BR crest and those which survived after 1956 lined and unlined black with the later crest . Many of the class retained steel smokebox door rings until withdrawal , except those rebuilt by Gresley with a larger boiler which also required a new smokebox . Many locos had their decorative valances removed in later years as well , though they still retained their distinctive character .", "answer": ["London & North Eastern Railway"], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/GER_Classes_S46,_D56_and_H88#P137#1"}

Her mother , Marie of Orl\u00e9ans , was the sister of King Louis XII of France . In 1523 Charles V appointed the couple jointly viceroys of Valencia . There Germaine , recently returned to Spain , dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds ( Germanies ) . Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats ; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total . This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza , who had favored reconciliation with the rebels In December 1524 , Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion . However , fines imposed on the guilds and guild-aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid . It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia , as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her . Next year after Johanns death in 1525 , Germaine married Ferdinand , Duke of Calabria , a son of King Frederick IV of Naples ( 1496\u20131501 ) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo .

Reiniger is also noted for having devised the first form of a multiplane camera ; she made more than 40 films , all using her invention . Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium . Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation .

Eventually in 1928 he went to the United States to take a faculty position at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland . At JHU he had to teach freshman classes in chemistry , and it quickly became apparent that , while he was a genius at developing theories in physical chemistry , he had little talent for teaching . He was dismissed by JHU after one semester . On leaving JHU , he accepted a position ( involving the teaching of statistical mechanics to graduate students in chemistry ) at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , where it became clear that he was no better at teaching advanced students than freshmen , but he made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . The only graduate student who could really understand his lectures on electrolyte systems , Raymond Fuoss , worked under him and eventually joined him on the Yale chemistry faculty . In 1933 , when the Great Depression limited Browns ability to support a faculty member who was only useful as a researcher and not a teacher , he was let go by Brown , being hired after a trip to Europe by Yale University , where he remained for most of the rest of his life , retiring in 1972 . His research at Brown was concerned mainly with the effects on diffusion of temperature gradients , and produced the Onsager reciprocal relations , a set of equations published in 1929 and , in an expanded form , in 1931 , in statistical mechanics whose importance went unrecognized for many years . However , their value became apparent during the decades following World War II , and by 1968 they were considered important enough to gain Onsager that years Nobel Prize in Chemistry In 1933 , just before taking up the position at Yale , Onsager traveled to Austria to visit electrochemist Hans Falkenhagen .

Leopold took a job with the United States Geological Survey , where she worked for 21 years , from 1955 to 1976 . She made important findings about the effects of climate on the evolution and extinction of prehistoric plant species In her work in the Rocky Mountains , she discovered that extinction and evolution of ancient species into newer varians was more prevalent in the middle of the continent because of the wider degree of seasonal changes ; in contrast , coastal areas with more moderate climates supported older species such as the giant redwood . Her work also included studying drilled cores containing pollen from the Miocene Epoch that revealed evidence of a tropical rainforest in the Eniwetok and Bikini Atoll area of the Pacific Ocean By studying plant fossil records from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado , Idaho , and Wyoming , Leopold provided inferences about the paleoenvironment of the Paleogene and Neogene periods . The 34-million-year-old plant fossils preserved in the Florissant Valley , southwest of Denver and now part of the Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument , yielded some of the key evidence for her studies .", "answer": ["University of Wisconsin"], "question_type": "between_explicit", "idx": "/wiki/Estella_Leopold#P69#0"}
