In 1873 Adam collaborated with Wells , shortly before he left for Australia , on the decoration and glazing of Belhaven Parish Church , Glasgow . Adams glass at Belhaven borrowed heavily from the repertoire which he had learned from Cottier , including Japanese-style foliage , quarries and sunflowers , with figurative panels based on Millais Parables , which may have been adapted from cartoons of identical windows produced in Cottiers studio .", "type": "narrow", "ID": 234}}
