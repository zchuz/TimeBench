There Germaine , recently returned to Spain , dealt with the fallout of the Revolt of the Brotherhoods by the Valencian guilds ( Germanies ) . Germaine favored harsh treatment of the agermanats ; she is thought to have signed the death warrants of 100 former rebels personally , and sources indicate that as many as 800 executions may have occurred in total . This undid the more lenient policy of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza , who had favored reconciliation with the rebels In December 1524 , Germaine signed a pardon that officially ended the persecution of all former participants in the rebellion . However , fines imposed on the guilds and guild-aligned cities as punishment would take many years to be repaid . It is maintained by Valencian historians that the fact that Germaine moved her court to Valencia was the first step in the degradation of social prestige of the Valencian language in the Kingdom of Valencia , as the higher classes started favouring Castilian/Spanish over their native language to please her . Next year after Johanns death in 1525 , Germaine married Ferdinand , Duke of Calabria , a son of King Frederick IV of Naples ( 1496\u20131501 ) by his second wife Isabella del Balzo . The two continued as viceroys of Valencia and were patrons of the arts and music . Germaine also encouraged the slow integration of Valencia with Castilian-dominated Spain as a whole .

It is usually kept in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , Paris . On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 .

That Klemzig is now in western Poland and is now known by the Polish name Kl\u0119psk . The initial establishment of Klemzig as an Old Lutheran settlement in the South Australian Colony is attributed to a decision by Pastor August Ludwig Christian Kavel . Pastor Kavel was determined to help his loyal parishioners emigrate from Brandenburg , Posen and Silesia to escape religious persecution by King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia . Pastor Kavel initially planned to move his parishioners to Russia near the Black Sea , where there were already numerous German settlements , but that had proved not to be feasible . Early in 1836 , Kavel travelled to Hamburg to investigate possible emigration to America , but lack of available financial assistance caused this plan to collapse . While in Hamburg , Kavel heard of the wealthy philanthropist , George Fife Angas , who was Chairman of the South Australian Company and likely to assist the Old Lutherans with their migration plans . Kavel and a representative of his congregation travelled to London in March 1836 and met a very sympathetic George Fife Angas . Angas was a Baptist and was convinced that the Old Lutherans , who placed such high value on their religious beliefs , would make excellent settlers in the South Australian Colony . Angas persuaded the Directors of the South Australian Company to support him in chartering and fitting out the barque Sarah which was to proceed to Hamburg . Here , 370 Old Lutherans were to set sail for South Australia on 8 June 1836 . However , Prussian authorities refused to grant the necessary passports until finally , after a distressing delay of nearly two years , the Prussian Government relented . Over the next six years , many ships brought Kavels Old Lutheran parishioners to the South Australian Colony .", "answer": ["unanswerable"], "question_type": "after_implicit", "idx": "/wiki/Klemzig,_South_Australia#P1448#2"}

His vote against the War of 1812 made since he leaned toward the Federalist Party at that time , but political gossip attributed this unpopular political stance to his wifes influence ( Eliza Johnson Pope was daughter of an Englishwoman , Catherine Nuth , wife of Joshua Johnson , and she had spent much of her youth in England ) The political fall-out led to his not running for re-election at the end of his term in 1813 . He and his wife returned to live in Lexington , Kentucky where he practiced law and taught at Transylvania University .

{"question": "What was the residence of Lotte Reiniger in Sep 1980?", "context": "Charlotte Lotte Reiniger ( 2 June 1899 \u2013 19 June 1981 ) was a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation . Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed , from 1926 , the first feature-length animated film , and Papageno ( 1935 ) . Reiniger is also noted for having devised the first form of a multiplane camera ; she made more than 40 films , all using her invention . Reiniger had a distinct art style in her animations that was very different from other artists in the time period of the 1920s and the 1930s , particularly in terms of characters . In the 1920s especially , characters tended to rely on facial expressions to express emotions or action , while Reinigers characters relied on gestures to display emotions or actions . She also utilized the technique of metamorphosis often in her animations . This focus on transformation greatly benefits her tendency to work with fairytale stories The Adventures of Prince Achmed specifically adapts fantastic elements to take advantage of animation to show things that could not be shown in reality . Reiniger considered animations separation from the laws of the material plane to be one of the greatest strengths of the medium . Because of this , Reinigers characters are not usually biologically correct , but they are able to express a fluidity which is very important to her style of expressionism . Although there are other animators in that time period that used these techniques , Reiniger stands out because she is able to accomplish this style using cutout animation . Reinigers figures resemble stop-motion animation in the way that they move .", "answer": ["unanswerable"], "question_type": "in_implicit", "idx": "/wiki/Lotte_Reiniger#P551#4"}

It is usually kept in the Mus\u00e9e dOrsay , Paris . On a trip to Spain in 1865 , \u00c9douard Manet visited the Prado , where the art of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez was a revelation . Upon his return to Paris in 1866 , he began work on a new painting , depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army . In this picture , Manet presents the uniformed boy , in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of V\u00e9lazquezs court portraits , against a barely inflected , flattened background of neutral tone , thus frustrating attempts to assess the figures true size and , by extension , importance . The painting , entitled Le fifre , was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866 . Outraged by the jurys decision , \u00c9mile Zola , an early champion of Manets art , published a series of articles in the newspaper L\u00c9venement , that praised Manets realist style and modern content . Following the example of Gustave Courbet , in May 1867 , Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the \u00c9xposition universelle The exhibition included Le fifre , which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting . The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893 . Between 1873 and 1893 , the painting was owned by Manets friend , composer and baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure . It was included in a large exhibition of Manets work in 1884 , a year after his premature death . Le fifre was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner , the Count Isaac de Camondo , and entered the national collections in 1911 . It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947 , when it was relocated to the Mus\u00e9e du Jeu de Paume . It was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983 , the 100th anniversary of the artists death .
