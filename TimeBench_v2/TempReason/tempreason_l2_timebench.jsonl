{"question": "Who was the owner of The Little Street in May, 1885?", "answer": ["Jan Pieter Six VI"], "context": "The Little StreetThe Little Street (\"Het Straatje\") is a painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, executed c. 1657\u201358. It is exhibited at the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam, and signed, below the window in the lower left-hand corner, \"I V MEER\".The painting is made in oil on canvas, and it is a relatively small painting, being high by wide.The painting, showing a quiet street, depicts a typical aspect of the life in a Dutch Golden Age town. It is one of only three Vermeer paintings of views of Delft, the others being \"View of Delft\" and the now lost \"House Standing in Delft\". This painting is considered to be an important work of the Dutch master.Straight angles alternate with the triangle of the house and of the sky giving the composition a certain vitality. The walls, stones and brickwork are painted in a thicker paint layer, such that it makes them almost palpable.Vermeer achieved the realistic depiction of the surfaces with the masterful application of a relatively limited number of pigments. He employed red ochre and madder lake for the reddish-brown brick wall, the blue in the sky contains lead white and natural ultramarine. The green shutters and foliage are painted with azurite mixed with lead-tin-yellow.While generally agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, the exact location of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and discussion, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.In 2015, archival research based on the city's quay dues register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways along the canals of Delft at the time, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42.The research also found that the property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the \"Penspoort\", or Tripe Gate. Vermeer\u2019s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.In 2017, this apparently sound conclusion was disputed by art historians Gert Eijkelboom and Gerrit Vermeer in the Dutch \"Journal of Historical Geography\" (\"Tijdschrift voor historische geografie\"). Their argumentation is essentially founded in the assertion that the painting does not depict an actual place, and thus cannot be accurately located. The authors said: \"We do not know whether the question will ever be answered, because it seems that Vermeer's world-famous work is an allegorical representation, which he compiled from various elements and places.\"", "fact_context": "The Little Street is owned by Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade from Jan, 1899 to Jan, 1905. \n The Little Street is owned by Hendrik Six van Hillegom from Jan, 1845 to Jan, 1847. \n The Little Street is owned by Jan Pieter Six VI from Jan, 1847 to Jan, 1899."}

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman\u2013Savage utility function.", "fact_context": "Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Cornell University from Jan, 1942 to Jan, 1943. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Institute for Advanced Study from Jan, 1941 to Jan, 1942. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Jan, 1945 to Jan, 1946. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Michigan from Jan, 1960 to Jan, 1964. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Chicago from Jan, 1946 to Jan, 1960. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Columbia University from Jan, 1944 to Jan, 1945. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Yale University from Jan, 1964 to Jan, 1971. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Brown University from Jan, 1943 to Jan, 1944."}

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore.

He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "\u010cedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Carlos Al\u00f3s Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Andr\u00e9 Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018."}

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space.

They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics Emeritus at Washington University in St. Louis. His research includes the study of intellectual property and endogenous growth in dynamic general equilibrium models, the endogenous formation of preferences, social norms and institutions, learning in games, and game theory applications to experimental economics.At UCLA, Levine obtained a B.A. in mathematics in 1977, and an M.A. in economics in the same year. He was awarded a Ph.D. in economics at MIT in June 1981. He became an assistant professor of economics at UCLA in July 1981, an associate professor of economics at the University of Minnesota in 1987, and a professor of economics at UCLA in the same year. In 1997 he became the Armen Alchian Professor of Economics at UCLA. In 2006 he moved to Washington University in St. Louis, where he became the John H. Biggs Distinguished Professor of Economics.Levine was the coeditor of the \"Review of Economic Dynamics\" from November 1996 to June 2001, and of \"Econometrica\" from July 2003 to June 2008. He presided the Society for Economic Dynamics from July 2006 to June 2009.Levine is a Fellow of the Econometric Society since 1989 and a research associate at NBER since 2006.David K. Levine conducts ongoing research in general equilibrium theory, focusing specifically on growth theory, innovation, and intellectual property. Collaborating with Michele Boldrin, Levine examines the role of increasing returns in growth and innovation. They posit that little evidence exists for increasing returns at the aggregate level, and thus argue that there is no reason to believe that increasing returns play an important role in growth. This theory concludes that existing claims for the necessity of intellectual property in the process of growth and innovation are greatly exaggerated.Levine also conducts research in the field of dynamic games. He established with Drew Fudenberg that a long-lived player playing in opposition to short-lived players can substitute reputation for commitment. He developed with Eric Maskin the first \"folk theorem\" for games in which players do not directly observe each other's decisions, with applications for learning in games. They argued that while learning theories cannot provide detailed descriptions of non-equilibrium behavior, they act as a useful tool in understanding which equilibria are likely to emerge. One example of this, they put forward, explains how superstitions survive in the face of rational learning.Levine currently studies the endogenous formation of preferences and social norms. His analysis of experimental anomalies explores some of the limitations of the standard economic model of self-interested individuals.", "fact_context": "David K.

In 1670, he was promoted to the rank of \"jinshi\" and moved to Beijing, leaving his brother Li Guangpo behind to look after his family. Li's career prospects improved when the Emperor pacified Fujian and acted on Li's suggestion to defeat Wu Sangui. He also helped defeat Geng Jingzhong, persuading his friend Chen Minglei to work as a spy in Geng's camp. Later in life, he was responsible for planning Shi Lang's conquest of Taiwan. During the course of his life, Li held various court positions, including Chancellor of the Hanlin Academy, Governor of Zhili and Grand Secretary, and positions on the Board of War, Board of Civil Service and the Board of Public Works.Li's philosophy was rooted in the Cheng-Zhu school. However, despite being a follower of Zhu Xi he did not entirely disregard the teachings of Zhu's rivals Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He also highlighted similarities between the teachings of Confucius and those of Buddha and Lao Tzu. Li felt that human nature (which he believed to be inherently good) was the ultimate subject of his study, and that nature was the guiding principle on which to base human morality.

Economist Milton Friedman said Savage was \"one of the few people I have met whom I would unhesitatingly call a genius.\"He graduated from the University of Michigan and later worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and the Statistical Research Group at Columbia University. Though his thesis advisor was Sumner Myers, he also credited Milton Friedman and W. Allen Wallis as statistical mentors.His most noted work was the 1954 book \"The Foundations of Statistics\", in which he put forward a theory of subjective and personal probability and statistics which forms one of the strands underlying Bayesian statistics and has applications to game theory.During World War II, Savage served as chief \"statistical\" assistant to John von Neumann, the mathematician credited with describing the principles upon which electronic computers should be based. Later he was one of the participants in the \"Macy conferences\" on cybernetics.One of Savage's indirect contributions was his discovery of the work of Louis Bachelier on stochastic models for asset prices and the mathematical theory of option pricing. Savage brought the work of Bachelier to the attention of Paul Samuelson. It was from Samuelson's subsequent writing that \"random walk\" (and subsequently Brownian motion) became fundamental to mathematical finance.In 1951 he introduced the minimax regret criterion used in decision theory.The Hewitt\u2013Savage zero\u2013one law is (in part) named after him, as is the Friedman\u2013Savage utility function.", "fact_context": "Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Brown University from Jan, 1943 to Jan, 1944. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences from Jan, 1945 to Jan, 1946. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Yale University from Jan, 1964 to Jan, 1971. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Institute for Advanced Study from Jan, 1941 to Jan, 1942. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Cornell University from Jan, 1942 to Jan, 1943. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Michigan from Jan, 1960 to Jan, 1964. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for University of Chicago from Jan, 1946 to Jan, 1960. \n Leonard Jimmie Savage works for Columbia University from Jan, 1944 to Jan, 1945."}

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369.

There are many Slutsky analogs in producer theory.He is less well known by Western economists than some of his contemporaries, due to his own changing intellectual interests as well as external factors forced upon him after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. His seminal paper in Economics, and some argue his last paper in Economics rather than probability theory, was published in 1915 (\"Sulla teoria del bilancio del consumatore\"). Paul Samuelson noted that until 1936, he had been entirely unaware of Slutsky's 1915 \"masterpiece\" due to World War I and the paper's Italian language publication. R. G. D. Allen did the most to propagate Slutsky's work on consumer theory in published papers in 1936 and 1950.Vincent Barnett argues:In the 1920s Slutsky turned to working on probability theory and stochastic processes, but in 1927 he published his second famous article on economic theory, 'The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes'. This showed that it was possible for apparently cyclic behaviour to emerge as the result of random shocks to the economy if the latter were modelled using a stable stochastic difference equation with certain technical properties. This opened up a new approach to business cycle theory by hypothesising that the interaction of chance events could generate periodicity when none existed initially.Slutsky's later work was principally in probability theory and the theory of stochastic processes. He is generally credited for the result known as Slutsky's theorem. In 1928 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Bologna.", "fact_context": "Eugen Slutsky works for Steklov Institute of Mathematics from Jan, 1939 to Jan, 1948. \n Eugen Slutsky works for Kyiv National Economic University named after Vadym Hetman from Jan, 1913 to Jan, 1926. \n Eugen Slutsky works for Moscow State University from Jan, 1934 to Jan, 1938. \n Eugen Slutsky works for Institute of Conjuncture from Jan, 1926 to Jan, 1930."}

The last years of the reign of Isabella II were times of growing discontent with her government and with the monarchy. Salmer\u00f3n joined a small party who advocated for the establishment of a republic. He was director of the opposition paper \"La Discusi\u00f3n\", and co-operated with Emilio Castelar on \"La Democracia\". In 1865 he was named one of the members of the directing committee of the Republican Party. In 1867 he was imprisoned with other suspects.When the revolution of September 1868 broke out, he was at Almer\u00eda recovering from a serious illness. Salmer\u00f3n was elected to the \"Cortes\" in 1871, and though he did not belong to the Socialist Party, defended its right to toleration.

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms.In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed.Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy.

The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success.

When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space.

In 2008 he was appointed associate professor, and in 2017 full professor. Before that, he worked at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, and MIT in the United States. He received his PhD from the University of Amsterdam in 1999 with a thesis entitled \"Millisecond phenomena in X-ray binaries\".His research focuses on the accretion of matter onto neutron stars and black holes, which are very compact stellar remnants. He uses X-ray space telescopes such as Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton to observe the X-ray emission from these objects. In particular he studies neutron stars and black holes when they are accreting at very low rates. He also investigates the rate at which neutron stars cool after they have been heated by accretion, in order to learn about their interior composition.

On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n \u010cedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021. \n Andr\u00e9 Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Carlos Al\u00f3s Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017."}

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369.

The building is three stories high and based on an Elizabethan-style \"E\"-shaped plan. The design is similar to that of the station but more subdued; the building was extended in 1878. The building is mainly brick-built, with blue stone diapering and a plain tiled roof and Dutch-style gables above the outer and central bay windows. The central ground floor bay forms a porch. The hotel was built to resemble an Elizabethan manor house. The hotel quickly built an up a good reputation and, within a few years, was regarded as one most important hotels in Staffordshire.When the County Borough of Stoke on Trent was formed in 1910, incorporating six towns, the hotel was chosen the venue for the inaugural meeting of the local council to avoid showing a bias by using one of the six town halls\u2014a matter of local sensitivity at the time. Subsequent meetings rotated between the town halls before the council decided to permanently locate itself in Stoke.The NSR preferred to lease the building, with limited success. When the NSR was amalgamated into the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923, the LMS took over the hotel and found the business in poor condition. When a lease expired in 1931, the LMS took the management of the hotel into its own hands and undertook an extensive refurbishment of the building. The hotel has been expanded several times during its history, including additional buildings to the rear, in order to provide more bedrooms and kitchen space. Not all the extensions were conducted sympathetically to the original architectural style, resulting in a variety of architectural styles to the rear of the building.The hotel became a listed building in 1972 and is listed in grade II*.

Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division.

{"question": "Who was the head coach of the team Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Aug, 2018?", "answer": ["Andr\u00e9 Paus"], "context": "Enosis Neon Paralimni FCEnosis Neon Paralimni Football Club (, \"Enosi Neon Paralimniou\", \"Youth Union of Paralimni\") is a Cypriot football team from Paralimni. Currently playing in the first division, it holds home games at the Paralimni Municipal Stadium \"Tasos Marcou\", which holds 5,800 people.Enosis Neon Paralimniou was founded in April 1944, following the merger of two Paralimni clubs, Heracles and People's Love.The club's emblem is the Parthenon, with a trumpeter and the year 1936 inscription, birth year of the club Heracles. The only reason why founders decided to adopt the year 1936 as the new club's birth year instead of the year 1944 has purely to do with Heracles official papers. On those, it was clear that whenever the club's members decided to cease its operations, all of its assets (movable and immovable property) would go straight to the Church. In view of that and in order to avoid any legal implications, the newly born club of Enosis was reckoned by the authorities as a continuation of the club Heracles of Paralimni, absorbing the other club, People's Love.The first football match played in Paralimni took place in the first half of the year 1945, some weeks before the end of World War II, against a German team of POWs (no further details found). The first recorded encounter was on 16 September 1945, against a mixed team from Anorthosis and EHAN, both of Famagusta (a final 4\u20135 loss).The team\u2019s colours of claret and blue were introduced by the Parnerou brothers who were both supporters of West Ham United and acquainted with player Bobby Moore. Moore donated West Ham United kits for the team to play in 1971, 2 years after the team's promotion to the Cypriot First Division . These colours became an established part of the club itself.Until the early 1960s, Enosis took part only in local competitions, since the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) had repeatedly denied its participation in its competitions, stating that only clubs based in towns could take part. The CFA's denial was the reason why Enosis joined E.A.P.O., a village-based club association. In 1965, the CFA changed its rules and Enosis finally managed to join and participate in the second division. From the very beginning, the side tried to win promotion to the first division and, after four attempts, managed to finish first, in the football season of 1968\u201369. Since then, Enosis has taken part in all 45 editions of first division, being one of only five clubs never to have been demoted into the second division until 2013\u201314, when it was relegated for the first time to the second division after finishing 13th in the league.", "fact_context": "Marinos Satsias is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jul, 2021 to Dec, 2022. \n Apostolos Makrides is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jun, 2017 to Oct, 2017. \n Kostas Kaiafas is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from May, 2016 to Feb, 2017. \n Carlos Al\u00f3s Ferrer is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Sep, 2020 to Mar, 2021. \n \u010cedomir Janevski is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Jan, 2020 to May, 2020. \n Andr\u00e9 Paus is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Oct, 2017 to Nov, 2018. \n Sotiris Antoniou is the head coach of Enosis Neon Paralimni FC from Apr, 2021 to May, 2021."}
