# TimeBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Temporal Reasoning Abilities in Large Language Models
This is the repository containing evaluation datas, instructions and demonstrations with paper _**TimeBench: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Temporal Reasoning Abilities in
  Large Language Models**_

Temporal reasoning, as an essential component of comprehending the world, has frequently been overlooked in previous research on Large Language Models (LLMs). In order to draw attention from the research community towards the temporal understanding capability of LLMs, we have introduced a comprehensive and hierarchical temporal reasoning benchmarks aligned with complex real-world scenario.


Just as the human cognitive process unfolds from foundational cognition and conceptual understanding to practical reasoning, we delineate temporal reasoning into three hierarchical levels.
Specifically, TimeBench categorizes temporal reasoning into symbolic, commonsense and event temporal reasoning, covering 10 datasets with a total of 16 subtasks with diverse task forms.
(1) Symbolic Temporal Reasoning focuses on comprehension of fundamental abstract temporal expressions.
(2) Temporal Commonsense Reasoning emphasizes the mastery of temporal principles, concepts and world knowledge.
(3) Event Temporal Reasoning concentrates on modeling the temporal relationships of events within authentic scenarios.
